I make stuff. An 8-bit CPU architecture then implemented across breadboards using ICs. A mix of useless and useful Discord Bots to manage members. Many websites.

Low Level is more fun but who has time to manage memory anyway. Just write over it. What could go wrong?

Writing specification material is fun too but thats a crime around these parts. It must be criminal to write good documentation, why else is there so little of it?
