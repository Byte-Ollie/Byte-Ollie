I make stuff
Custom physical 8 bit CPU and CPU architecture
Discord Bots
Websites
And a long list of unfinished projects

Low Level is more fun but who has time for that anyway

Writing is also cool, document your projects or I may eat you alive

Sometimes I work as well
Student Dev for a year at NHS
Wrote specification material, aided other developers, testing, bug-fixing and technical support to clinicians, good stuff
